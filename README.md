Vim Syntax Highlighting for MicroVM Intermediate Representation
===============================================================

Copy all directories into your `~/.vim/` directory, but
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) or
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is recommended for managing
your Vim plugins.

There are some ÂµIR snippets in the `tests` directory of the
[microvm-refimpl](https://github.com/microvm-project/microvm-refimpl) project.
